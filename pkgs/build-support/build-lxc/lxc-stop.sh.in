# In theory we should just do a
# exec @libvirt@/bin/virsh -c lxc:/// shutdown @name@
# but that doesn't work for various reasons. So instead, we're doing a:
exec @libvirt@/bin/virsh -c lxc:/// send-process-signal @name@ 1 37
# 37 is SIGRTMIN+3 which is the "correct" signal to send the guest systemd to make it shut down.
